Goals

I aim to always keep on improving my skills in programming and gathering experience in software production in general. I'm also interested in the business side of software and project management. I've done an international minor in Canada in HRM/Business and worked as a project manager. I'm motivated best by getting challenging projects and working with a professional group of people, I've always enjoyed the social aspect of working in team projects. 
I have interests towards various fields of software and technology, including creating visual applications (games, mobile apps, business solutions etc.) with innovative twists and new design, and learning more about new technologies such as Virtual Reality, AI, and 3D in general.
