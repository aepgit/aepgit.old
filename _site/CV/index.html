I’m motivated best by getting challenging projects and working with a professional group of people, I’ve always enjoyed the social aspect of working in team projects. 
I have interests towards various fields of software and technology, including creating visual applications (games, mobile apps, business solutions etc.) with innovative twists and new design, and learning more about new technologies such as Virtual Reality, AI, and 3D in general.</p>
